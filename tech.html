     <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
     <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>

     <ul>
       <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
       <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
     </ul>

     <p>his guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
     

     <ul>
       <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
       <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
       <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>
     </ul>

    <section id="Hello_world" class="main-section">
      <header class="header-section">
      Hello world
      </header>
      <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
      <code>
        function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
greetMe("World");
      </code>
      <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>

      Declaring Variables
      </header> 
      <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
      <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
      <code>
        var x = 42.
      </code>
      <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
      <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
 <code>
        x = 42.
      </code>
      <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>
      <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
      <code>
        let y = 13.
      </code>

      <code>
        let y = 16.
      </code>
      <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>

    </section>




    <section id="Variable_scope" class="main-section">
      <header class="header-section">
      Variable scope
      </header>
      <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
      <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.

</p>
      <code>
       if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5

      </code>
      <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
      
 <code>
        if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
not defined
      </code>
